                               I was born to Abate Lemu and Etay Abreha on January 11, 2000 G.C
                               in Addis Ababa ,Ethiopia. I started school at the age of 4
                               at Ethio-Parents' School in Gerji,Addis Ababa. I finished
                               primary and secondary education at this same school. I
                               graduated high school in the year 2017/18 and applied to
                               Addis Ababa University in the field of engineering.</p>
