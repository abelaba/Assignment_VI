                                        players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the

                                        a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894.
                                        This version lacks the image of a hung man, instead relying on
                                        keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill
                                        in the blanks.</p></td>

                                 <td><p>The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes , representing
                                      each letter of the word . In most variants, proper nouns, such as
                                      names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words,
                                      sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not
                                      allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the
                                      word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the
                                      suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws
                                      one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark .
                                      The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the
                                      whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser
                                      wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the
                                      guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if
                                      the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his
                                      opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time
                                      with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by
                                      guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing
                                      the word, before the diagram is completed.</p> </td>

                                 <td><p>As the name of the game suggests, the diagram is designed to look
                                        like a hanging man. Although debates have arisen about the
                                        questionable taste of this picture, it is still in use today. A
                                        common alternative for teachers is to draw an apple tree with ten
                                        apples, erasing or crossing out the apples as the guesses are used
                                        up. The exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the
                                        gallows before play and draw parts of the man's body (traditionally
                                        the head, then the torso , then the arms and legs one by one). Some
                                        players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual
                                        elements of the gallows as part of the game, effectively giving the
                                        guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man
                                        can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players
                                        include a face on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time.
                                        Some players include beheading the head as the last chance by
                                        drawing a line at the neck. Some modifications to game play ( house rules )
                                        to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting
                                        guesses on high-frequency consonants and vowels . Another
                                        alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to
                                        facilitate the learning of a foreign language .</p> </td>
