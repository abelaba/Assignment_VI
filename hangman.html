              <h1>Hangman Game</h1>
              <p>by <a href="index.html">Abel Abate</a> on December 10, 2019</p>

               <p>Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more
                  players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the
                  other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain
                  =number of guesses. This game was developed using python.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned
                 a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894.
                 This version lacks the image of a hung man, instead relying on
                 keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill
                 in the blanks.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes , representing
                 each letter of the word . In most variants, proper nouns, such as
                 names, places, and brands, are not allowed. Slang words,
                 sometimes referred to as informal or shortened words, are also not
                 allowed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the
                 word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the
                 suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws
                 one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark .
                 The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the
                  whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser
                  wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the
                  guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if
                 the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his
                opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time
                  with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by
                  guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing
                  the word, before the diagram is completed.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h2>Variants</h2>
              <p>As the name of the game suggests, the diagram is designed to look
                 like a hanging man. Although debates have arisen about the
                 questionable taste of this picture, it is still in use today. A
                common alternative for teachers is to draw an apple tree with ten
                apples, erasing or crossing out the apples as the guesses are used
                up. The exact nature of the diagram differs; some players draw the
                gallows before play and draw parts of the man's body (traditionally
                the head, then the torso , then the arms and legs one by one). Some
                players begin with no diagram at all, and drawing the individual
                elements of the gallows as part of the game, effectively giving the
                guessing players more chances. The amount of detail on the man
                can also vary, affecting the number of chances. Some players
                include a face on the head, either all at once or one feature at a time.
                Some players include beheading the head as the last chance by
                drawing a line at the neck. Some modifications to game play ( house rules )
                to increase the difficulty level are sometimes implemented, such as limiting
                guesses on high-frequency consonants and vowels . Another
                alternative is to give the definition of the word; this can be used to
                facilitate the learning of a foreign language .</p>
